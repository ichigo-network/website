    whatIsIchigo: {
      question: 'What is Ichigo network ?',
      answer: 'Ichigo is a protocol relying on blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies to decentralize all social media components and place human users at the center of the ecosystem, while removing the need for any intermediate or central authority.',
    },
    whatDifferentiateIchigo: {
      question: 'What differentiate Ichigo Network?',
      answer: 'Ichigo network is based on leading globally-adopted technologies : Solana blockchain and IPFS, so you know its fundamentals are solid. It is the first project to propose a fully end-to-end social ecosystem implementing all necessary components in a decentralized manner: Storage provider, Application-layer,  Advertisement Marketplace, and incentive distribution to Content Creators and End-users. Project development is steered by the community to become a completely decentralized platform with all necessary components built-in.',
    },
    whatIsTargetAndVision: {
      question: 'What is your target and vision?',
      answer: 'We envision a new social ecosystem without gatekeepers or intermediaries where no entities are able to abuse a dominant position and in which its community can finally thrive in a fair and free environment, truly making our digital world a better place.',
